A collection of my solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenges, organized by year and day. 
Each folder contains code, problem descriptions, 
and any notes or approaches I used while solving the puzzles. 
This repo serves as a learning journal, showcasing problem-solving 
techniques and the evolution of my coding skills over time.
